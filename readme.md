# Circuit Simulator
This is a simple excercise with impedance transformations in a single port device with matching network.

The set of scripts is still very much work in progress. Last time tested with:
* Python 3.7.4
* skrf.__version__  '0.14.9'
* np.__version__  '1.17.1'
* matplotlib.__version__  '3.1.1'
